My academic journey began with physics. While physics remains a passion, I discovered that I am equally drawn to **coding, problem solving, and building software systems**. I had the chance to work on **machine learning projects** and several computer science-related research projects. This inspired me to take additional computer science courses and ultimately earn a combined degree. Over time, I‚Äôve transitioned my focus toward **full stack development and machine learning applications**.
